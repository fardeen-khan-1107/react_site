            The CubeHouse aligns perfectly with <br />
            the cities plans for the Zuidasdok. This <br />
             plan envisions the Zuidas as <br />
              Amsterdamâ€™s second center, a well- <br />
              connected, international area where <br />
               working, living and enjoying life are all <br />
                interconnected.
