            The CubeHouse is designed with the 
             15-minute City concept in mind. This 
              means that everyone should have 
              access to essential urban services 
               within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. 
                Thanks to its location at the heart of 
                 the Zuidas, The CubeHouse is perfectly 
                 connected. It will only take you 2 
                  minutes to get to the new Zuidas 
                  Station (by foot); 5 minutes to Schiphol 
                   International Airport (by train) and 8 
                   minutes to Amsterdam Central Station 
                    (by train). Various shops and 
                    restaurants in the beating heart of the 
                     Zuidas, as well as numerous schools 
                      and universities, are just around the 
                      corner.

            The CubeHouse aligns perfectly with <br />
            the cities plans for the Zuidasdok. This <br />
             plan envisions the Zuidas as <br />
              Amsterdamâ€™s second center, a well- <br />
              connected, international area where <br />
               working, living and enjoying life are all <br />
                interconnected.
